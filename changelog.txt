v0.1b3  - (Aug 7, 2022)
        - ADDED: Created a 2nd page showing indicators for all of the main functions, solar, grid, home and power-
          walls. Each progressbar is measured based on values in the setup, including number of powerwalls, max
          power generation from both solar, and the max load of your home. Also, calculating a runtime based on
          current battery percentage and current load on the home. An indicator was also added to show the max
          load your powerwalls can take based on how many powerwalls you have vs. the load in your home.
        - FIXED: Made a modifcation on the grid ASCII graphic... still not satisfied, but it's getting better.

v0.1b2  - (Aug 7, 2022)
        - FIXED: Main focus is on the UI at this point, and making sure it aligns visually with the stock Tesla app,
          and is functionally/visually in line.  Will be adding more functionality and stats at a later point. ;) 
          Changed up the look/feel of the main UI, and making sure that everything looks the same.  I noticed on my
          first release that there were some differences in the ways that grid, solar and home were being displayed,
          so now they are more uniform.

v0.1b   - (Aug 6, 2022)
        - RELEASE - Initial release of PWRMON! Enjoy. Lots more to be added... keep your ideas and suggestions coming!
