v1.21   - (TBA)
        - ADDED: Thanks to the excellent suggestion of @JGrana, I have added a secondary email address
          for the purposes of sending SMS/Text messages to your phone during major Powerwall events!
          The format for the email address must be: 1234567890@carrierdomainname.com, or as specified
          by your carrier. Most all carriers have added the capability of sending SMS/Text messages
          to you via email. Please see this website for further info and format of your carriers
          SMS/Text email format: https://avtech.com/articles/138/list-of-email-to-sms-addresses/
        - FIXED: Detection of malformed API returns from weather.gov, preventing nulls and other errors,
          and requests a retransmission in order to present valid weather data.
        - FIXED: Runtime calculations when greater than 3 digits would screw up the alignment of the
          visualizations, and capped max runtime amounts at +99.9h.  

v1.20   - (September 29, 2022)
        - MAJOR: In recognition of major Hurricane Ian, I have integrated a 3 day weather forecast that
          includes today's current conditions, giving you all necessary info to get a good idea what's
          going to happen with the weather. Forecast includes current/upcoming conditions, temperature,
          and wind direction/speed. Ability to see detailed conditions expands on the current and
          upcoming conditions, including chances of rain. This functionality uses a free API from
          weather.gov, and determines your location from the coordinates of your WAN exit IP to determine
          the weather for your local region. It will be close, but may not be exactly the weather that is
          happening on top of your house.  Will look into allowing you to add custom longitude and
          latitude coordinates in the near future.
        - CHANGED: Included JQ as part of the prerequisites needed to be installed when PWRMON is set up
          for the first time. This was my error, thinking that the JQ tool was either already installed by
          default, or came along with an Entware install by default.  Now, when going into Setup -> Config,
          the script will check for the existence of JQ, and will prompt an install if it's not already
          present under /opt/bin. JQ is necessary for pulling data from your Tesla Powerwall Gateway API
          for the purposes of extracting current power stats. Added a check when the script starts up to
          ensure that all prerequisites are in place before running the script. Thanks to @monakh for
          noticing this behavior with JQ on a fresh install of VPNMON-R2!

v1.18   - (September 19, 2022)
        - ADDED: Email notification capabilities for major grid events: Down, Syncing or Return to Normal.
          Added the necessary setup menu items to record TO:, FROM:, SMTP Server, SMTP Port, Password, etc.
          Please note, this has only been tested on SSL SMTP connections, like smtps://smtp.gmail.com on
          port 465. I can add other methods of authentication if requests are made. Please note #2, in
          order for you to make use of a service like gmail in a case like this, you will need to obtain
          an "app password" to provide the necessary authentication using this method. And note #3, your
          smtp password is encrypted and saved in a config file that resides locally on the router under
          /jffs/addons/pwrmon.d/pwrmon.cfg, however, please know that due to the security constraints on
          these types of routers, I would still consider this to be an unsafe method of storage, and could
          still very easily be compromised by someone who knows what they're doing. Only use non-essential
          email accounts to send or receive these emails so you don't risk a primary account compromise!
        - CHANGED: The behavior of the "pwrmon -screen" command, so that when you execute this commandline
          parameter, it first will look for orphaned screens and wipe them... then, it will launch PWRMON
          into a new screen environment, and connect to it. This skips the original behavior where it drops
          back to a command prompt, and asks the user to connect to the PWRMON screen by requiring the user
          to run the "screen -r pwrmon" command. If a screen session is already running, and you type
          "pwrmon -screen", it will then connect to this screen session without requiring any user input.
          Thanks much to @TITAN for the great suggestion!

v1.16   - (September 10, 2022)
        - ADDED: Capability to go to a (P)revious page like on RTRMON.  You can now flip back and forth
          between pages, instead of having to run through them all to get to the same point. Yey!
        - ADDED: Logging entries for grid outage and grid syncing events.  Depending on the length of your
          outages, initially, you may want to keep track of the size of your pwrmon.log file, and delete
          lines as necessary. I will be building in a trimming function at a later date.

v1.15   - (August 31, 2022)
        - FIXED: Enhanced some of the look/feel to match the overall colors/theme of the app
        - ADDED: Included current battery configuration mode, ie. backup, self-powered, and time-based, as
          well as the percentage of backup reserve that is currently configured.
        - ADDED: Now displaying the % battery remaining on the large font dashboard view (page 3)

v1.12   - (August 24, 2022)
        - FIXED: Minor logic changes to successfully use API values coming from the Gateway in order to show
          Grid down/resyncing messages.
        - ADDED: Grid down/syncing indicators in the large font view (page 3), switching icons to red, giving
          user proper notification when these events happen.
        
v1.1    - (August 18, 2022)
        - MAJOR: Added a major feature on the new 3rd page that displays powerflows for solar, grid, home and
          battery in large font numbers for the purposes of displaying this on a full-time dashboard in your
          home. The large fonts are especially welcome so you can read what's happening on your local power
          grid from across the room. Designed to take advantage of cheap 7" tablets or wall touch displays,
          to provide a suite of monitoring apps (along with VPNMON-R2 and RTRMON) so you can see what's
          happening in your environment at all times.
        - ADDED: Added visual cue notifications on the Power Flow View (page 1) when the grid goes down, or 
          comes back up, but is not in sync yet with your Gateway device.
        - FIXED: Minor changes and corrections.

v1.0    - (August 15, 2022)
        - Initial release of PWRMON!  All bugs and inconsistencies have been resolved as of this first major
          release, providing the basic functionality of showing powerflows from solar, to/from home, to/from the
          grid, and to/from your batteries.  The secondary page (by hitting the (N)ext key) shows further details
          using progress bar views.  Calculations on expected runtime based on current load is displayed on both
          pages. All complimentary setup, config, view logs, update and uninstall menu pages are in place.

v0.1b3  - (August 7, 2022)
        - ADDED: Created a 2nd page showing indicators for all of the main functions, solar, grid, home and power-
          walls. Each progressbar is measured based on values in the setup, including number of powerwalls, max
          power generation from both solar, and the max load of your home. Also, calculating a runtime based on
          current battery percentage and current load on the home. An indicator was also added to show the max
          load your powerwalls can take based on how many powerwalls you have vs. the load in your home.
        - FIXED: Made a modifcation on the grid ASCII graphic... still not satisfied, but it's getting better.

v0.1b2  - (August 7, 2022)
        - FIXED: Main focus is on the UI at this point, and making sure it aligns visually with the stock Tesla app,
          and is functionally/visually in line.  Will be adding more functionality and stats at a later point. ;) 
          Changed up the look/feel of the main UI, and making sure that everything looks the same.  I noticed on my
          first release that there were some differences in the ways that grid, solar and home were being displayed,
          so now they are more uniform.

v0.1b   - (August 6, 2022)
        - RELEASE - Initial release of PWRMON! Enjoy. Lots more to be added... keep your ideas and suggestions coming!
