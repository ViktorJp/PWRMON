v1.2.9  - (February 7, 2024)
        - PATCH: Changed some logic to restart the script if it has trouble connecting to the Powerwall Gateway, or if
          certain values come back as null, indicating that it's having trouble connecting to the API. Inserted some timers
          in certain places to give an indication that the script is waiting for services to be restored before trying
          again.
        - PATCH: Changed the versioning logic to align with the general accepted way of versioning, using the notation:
          major.minor.patch ... finally, right? After seeing @thelonelycoder changing his ways, I figured it was probably
          time for me as well. All my scripts moving forward will go this route.

v1.27   - (August 31, 2023)
        - MINOR: Changed some of the notification wording that PWRMON uses when notifying you of a powerwall event via
          email and text, to make it more obvious what kind of event you're dealing with when you first glance at the
          notification. Having gone through Hurricane Idalia just recently made me realize that these notifications needed
          fixing.

v1.26   - (January 11, 2023)
        - FIXED: Minor updates to take care of some "Large Font" screen (pg 3) rendering that was happening when the script
          loses contact with the Powerwall Gateway.  Will now show "UKN %" if the battery percentage data isn't available
          from the Gateway.

v1.25   - (November 20, 2022)
        - ADDED: An auto-rotate option is now available by hitting the (R)otate pgs option from any of the currently 3 other
          stats screens.  When doing so, PWRMON will automatically advance to the next page, and loop through each until you
          disable this feature by again hitting the (R)otate pgs key.
        - ADDED: An option to choose a more minimalist progress bar. You can specify if you want the standard or minimalist
          progress bar under the config menu, item #9. For those who found it annoying or distracting, enjoy!
        - CHANGED: As with VPNMON-R2 and RTRMON, now when you make changes to the config while running the program, upon return
          to the main UI, your changes will automatically be applied without needing to exit and restart.
        - CHANGED: Modified the update functionality to allow you to force-update your current PWRMON script with the current
          build available on github.
        - MINOR: Small wording changes around the setup menu when it comes to installing Entware prerequisites. Added a check
          when the script starts up to ensure that all prerequisites are in place before running the script.
        - MINOR: Added the "kW" measurement notation next to the large font dashboard on page 3, in case there is any confusion
          on what those digits stand for. ;)

v1.22   - (October 5, 2022)
        - FIXED: the -wipe SCREEN command is now being checked earlier before the script determines how it is going to initiate
          a SCREEN session.
        - FIXED: Further refinement on fixing malformed API returns from weather.gov in order to prevent null results from
          tainting the rest of the results. Seems to be good now!

v1.21   - (October 3, 2022)
        - ADDED: Thanks to the excellent suggestion of @JGrana, I have added a secondary email address for the purposes of
          sending SMS/Text messages to your phone during major Powerwall events! The format for the email address must be:
          1234567890@carrierdomainname.com, or as specified by your carrier. Most all carriers have added the capability of
          sending SMS/Text messages to you via email. Please see this website for further info and format of your carriers
          SMS/Text email format: https://avtech.com/articles/138/list-of-email-to-sms-addresses/
        - FIXED: Detection of malformed API returns from weather.gov, preventing nulls and other errors, in order to present
          valid weather data each and every time.
        - FIXED: Runtime calculations when greater than 3 digits would screw up the alignment of the visualizations, and
          capped max runtime remaining amounts at +99.9h.  

v1.20   - (September 29, 2022)
        - MAJOR: In recognition of major Hurricane Ian, I have integrated a 3 day weather forecast that includes today's current
          conditions, giving you all necessary info to get a good idea what's going to happen with the weather. Forecast includes
          current/upcoming conditions, temperature, and wind direction/speed. Ability to see detailed conditions expands on the
          current and upcoming conditions, including chances of rain. This functionality uses a free API from weather.gov, and
          determines your location from the coordinates of your WAN exit IP to determine the weather for your local region. It
          will be close, but may not be exactly the weather that is happening on top of your house.  Will look into allowing you
          to add custom longitude and latitude coordinates in the near future.
        - CHANGED: Included JQ as part of the prerequisites needed to be installed when PWRMON is set up for the first time. This
          was my error, thinking that the JQ tool was either already installed by default, or came along with an Entware install
          by default.  Now, when going into Setup -> Config, the script will check for the existence of JQ, and will prompt an
          install if it's not already present under /opt/bin. JQ is necessary for pulling data from your Tesla Powerwall Gateway
          API for the purposes of extracting current power stats. Added a check when the script starts up to ensure that all
          prerequisites are in place before running the script. Thanks to @monakh for noticing this behavior with JQ on a fresh
          install of VPNMON-R2!

v1.18   - (September 19, 2022)
        - ADDED: Email notification capabilities for major grid events: Down, Syncing or Return to Normal. Added the necessary
          setup menu items to record TO:, FROM:, SMTP Server, SMTP Port, Password, etc. Please note, this has only been tested
          on SSL SMTP connections, like smtps://smtp.gmail.com on port 465. I can add other methods of authentication if requests
          are made. Please note #2, in order for you to make use of a service like gmail in a case like this, you will need to
          obtain an "app password" to provide the necessary authentication using this method. And note #3, your smtp password is
          encrypted and saved in a config file that resides locally on the router under /jffs/addons/pwrmon.d/pwrmon.cfg, however,
          please know that due to the security constraints on these types of routers, I would still consider this to be an unsafe
          method of storage, and could still very easily be compromised by someone who knows what they're doing. Only use non-
          essential email accounts to send or receive these emails so you don't risk a primary account compromise!
        - CHANGED: The behavior of the "pwrmon -screen" command, so that when you execute this commandline parameter, it first
          will look for orphaned screens and wipe them... then, it will launch PWRMON into a new screen environment, and connect
          to it. This skips the original behavior where it drops back to a command prompt, and asks the user to connect to the
          PWRMON screen by requiring the user to run the "screen -r pwrmon" command. If a screen session is already running, and
          you type "pwrmon -screen", it will then connect to this screen session without requiring any user input. Thanks much to
          @TITAN for the great suggestion!

v1.16   - (September 10, 2022)
        - ADDED: Capability to go to a (P)revious page like on RTRMON.  You can now flip back and forth between pages, instead of
          having to run through them all to get to the same point. Yey!
        - ADDED: Logging entries for grid outage and grid syncing events.  Depending on the length of your outages, initially,
          you may want to keep track of the size of your pwrmon.log file, and delete lines as necessary. I will be building in a
          trimming function at a later date.

v1.15   - (August 31, 2022)
        - FIXED: Enhanced some of the look/feel to match the overall colors/theme of the app
        - ADDED: Included current battery configuration mode, ie. backup, self-powered, and time-based, as well as the percentage
          of backup reserve that is currently configured.
        - ADDED: Now displaying the % battery remaining on the large font dashboard view (page 3)

v1.12   - (August 24, 2022)
        - FIXED: Minor logic changes to successfully use API values coming from the Gateway in order to show Grid down/resyncing
          messages.
        - ADDED: Grid down/syncing indicators in the large font view (page 3), switching icons to red, giving user proper
          notification when these events happen.
        
v1.1    - (August 18, 2022)
        - MAJOR: Added a major feature on the new 3rd page that displays powerflows for solar, grid, home and battery in large font
          numbers for the purposes of displaying this on a full-time dashboard in your home. The large fonts are especially welcome
          so you can read what's happening on your local power grid from across the room. Designed to take advantage of cheap 7"
          tablets or wall touch displays, to provide a suite of monitoring apps (along with VPNMON-R2 and RTRMON) so you can see
          what's happening in your environment at all times.
        - ADDED: Added visual cue notifications on the Power Flow View (page 1) when the grid goes down, or comes back up, but is
          not in sync yet with your Gateway device.
        - FIXED: Minor changes and corrections.

v1.0    - (August 15, 2022)
        - Initial release of PWRMON!  All bugs and inconsistencies have been resolved as of this first major release, providing the
          basic functionality of showing powerflows from solar, to/from home, to/from the grid, and to/from your batteries.  The
          secondary page (by hitting the (N)ext key) shows further details using progress bar views.  Calculations on expected
          runtime based on current load is displayed on both pages. All complimentary setup, config, view logs, update and uninstall
          menu pages are in place.

v0.1b3  - (August 7, 2022)
        - ADDED: Created a 2nd page showing indicators for all of the main functions, solar, grid, home and powerwalls. Each
          progressbar is measured based on values in the setup, including number of powerwalls, max power generation from both solar,
          and the max load of your home. Also, calculating a runtime based on current battery percentage and current load on the
          home. An indicator was also added to show the max load your powerwalls can take based on how many powerwalls you have vs.
          the load in your home.
        - FIXED: Made a modifcation on the grid ASCII graphic... still not satisfied, but it's getting better.

v0.1b2  - (August 7, 2022)
        - FIXED: Main focus is on the UI at this point, and making sure it aligns visually with the stock Tesla app, and is
          functionally/visually in line.  Will be adding more functionality and stats at a later point. ;) Changed up the look/feel
          of the main UI, and making sure that everything looks the same.  I noticed on my first release that there were some
          differences in the ways that grid, solar and home were being displayed, so now they are more uniform.

v0.1b   - (August 6, 2022)
        - RELEASE - Initial release of PWRMON! Enjoy. Lots more to be added... keep your ideas and suggestions coming!
